                The second website I participated in the creation of was the tourism website, Voyager. This website used
                html, but the bigger challenge that I faced was in regard to the CSS. With this project, I planned on
                honing my skills with CSS and to learn how to use it effectively. Some concepts that I learned during
                the creation process were media queries and general spacing of things with CSS. In learning how to use
                media queries, I learned that it wasn’t as simple as just sizing everything down to scale. We had to
                reformat the site for each screen size so that it looked good on smaller screens. Something that worked
                well during the creation process was when we cut down the website's zoom by 50%, which made the website
                look and format much better. Something that caused us trouble was creating the media queries, as we had
                to reformat basically the whole website so that the content didn’t seem super squished and too small for
                the screen size. While creating the website, we had to persist through lots of redesigns and issues with
                our code, and we also had to work out how to collaborate with each other, as conflicting schedules and
                ideas made for teamwork and communication issues.
