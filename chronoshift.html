                The first Website that I created was my Chronoshift website. This website mainly used the
                programming
                language HTML5, and there was very little other code. I was just startling to learn how to use the
                language, so my initial goal was to get the basic understanding of it down. During the creation
                process,
                I had to learn how to format properly so that the website appeared in the order I wanted it to. I
                also
                had to learn how to make things link to other pages when clicked on, so that the user could navigate
                in
                an efficient manner throughout the website. Something that I struggled a lot with was getting the
                boxes
                on screen to appear in the right order and in the specific area I wanted them to. I ended up having
                to
                rewrite a large portion of my code to fix this issue. Something that worked really well for me was
                applying a lot of the information and images to the website. I had to change some things around to
                make
                it format properly, but for the most part, it went very smoothly. During the project, I found myself
                constantly communicating with my peers and Mr Fast to figure out what went wrong with my code. After
                the
                project was completed, I reflected on things I should have done differently, like not naming all of
                my
                information containers ‘box’ and then a number, so that I can actually tell what I am changing so I
                don’t accidentally throw off the whole page.
