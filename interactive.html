                My third website for this class was the interactive story. This website was very javascript heavy, and
                that was the most difficult part for me. While working on this, I planned on honing my abilities with
                JavaScript and improving my skills with arrays specifically. One important concept I learned was how to
                use arrays to generate options in the form of buttons on screen. Something that worked in my head but
                not in practice was that I wanted to take a number value from the button clicked and translate that into
                more options via an array, but we actually had to assign each option to a name and that name linked to
                more text and more options. Something that worked really well was the restart button and the start
                button. Once we got the normal buttons figured out, the start button was basically just a normal button
                but with only one option, and the restart button was simply a refresh button. While creating the
                website, we had to persist through lots of repetitive code, because we had to create the JavaScript for
                each button individually. We also had to communicate with each other a lot while actually creating the
                story, because we basically just threw out random ideas and wrote down what stuck.
