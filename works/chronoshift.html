                    The first Website that I created was my Chronoshift website. This website mainly used the
                    programming
                    language HTML5, and there was very little other code. I was just startling to learn how to use the
                    language, so my initial goal was to get the basic understanding of it down. During the creation
                    process,
                    I had to learn how to format properly so that the website appeared in the order I wanted it to. I
                    also
                    had to learn how to make things link to other pages when clicked on, so that the user could navigate
                    in
                    an efficient manner throughout the website. Something that I struggled a lot with was getting the
                    boxes
                    on screen to appear in the right order and in the specific area I wanted them to. I ended up having
                    to
                    rewrite a large portion of my code to fix this issue. Something that worked really well for me was
                    applying a lot of the information and images to the website. I had to change some things around to
                    make
                    it format properly, but for the most part, it went very smoothly. During the project, I found myself
                    constantly communicating with my peers and Mr Fast to figure out what went wrong with my code. After
                    the
                    project was completed, I reflected on things I should have done differently, like not naming all of
                    my
                    information containers ‘box’ and then a number, so that I can actually tell what I am changing so I
                    don’t accidentally throw off the whole page.
